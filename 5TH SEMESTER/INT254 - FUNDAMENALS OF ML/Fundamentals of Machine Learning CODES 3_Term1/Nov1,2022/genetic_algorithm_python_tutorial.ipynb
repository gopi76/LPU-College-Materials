    "The Genetic Algorithm is a class of evolutionary algorithm that is broadly inspired by biological evolution. We all know evolution, it is a selection of parents, reproduction, and mutation of offsprings. The main aim of evolution is to reproduce offsprings that are biologically better than their parents. Genetic algorithm is mainly based on natural selection and it tries to simulate the theory of evolution."
